# Community Engagement Management System

## Overview
The **Community Engagement Management System** is designed to address the challenges communities face due to fragmented communication and disconnected interactions. This unified system aims to streamline community engagement, foster collaboration, and improve participation by providing a comprehensive platform for members to stay informed and actively engage in events and projects.

## Problem Statement
Communities today struggle with fragmented communication and disconnected interactions among their members. Currently, members utilize various platforms to stay informed, participate in events, and connect with one another, resulting in inefficiencies and missed opportunities for meaningful engagement. The existing systems often lack a user-friendly interface, which limits active participation.

## Key Features
